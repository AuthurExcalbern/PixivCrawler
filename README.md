# PixivCrawler

**If you want to use PixivCrawler, you should be able to access pixiv normally.**

[Pixiv][wiki-pixiv]  is a Japanese online community for artists.

I have seen the [robots.txt][pixiv-robots] of Pixiv. But it has nothing. If you know angthing about it, welcome to `issue` or send email to me.

Pixiv is a good webside. I get many great images from Pixiv. But No batch download service is provided by Pixiv. So I made this crawler to download my `bookmark images`.

## Function
- Help you download your Pixiv `bookmark images` efficiently.
- Use cookies to remember your username and password.

## Future
- Add GUI.

## Use
- Use `python3 run.py` to start.
- If you meet connecting error, you can try it again...
